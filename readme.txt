To perform a project using Amazon Web Services (AWS), you might need to know about the following:

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
EC2 is part of AWS's cloud-computing platform that allows users to rent virtual computers. 
EC2 provides a web service that allows users to boot an Amazon Machine Image to configure a virtual machine.

Autoscaling
Autoscaling is a method that automatically adjusts the amount of computational resources in a server farm.
For example, the number of servers running behind a web application may be increased or decreased automatically based on the number of active users on the site.

Load balancing services
Load balancers are a useful tool to deal with distributed denial of service attacks. 
Load balancers can also monitor traffic and block malicious content.

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
VPC stands for Virtual Private Cloud. You can launch instances in a subnet of your choosing, 
or connect one VPC with another VPC through a direct network route using private IP addresses.
